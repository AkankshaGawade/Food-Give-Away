Food Give Away App
Another web app idea is for a social cause. Most might have wondered what the restaurants or caterers do with their extra food. It is probably wasted or going unused. What if we can feed the needy?

What if someone can design an app to make use of these extra foods? An app that guides the restaurant or caterers to find out people who have no food to eat. 

There are thousands of people who don’t have enough food to eat; many are there who can manage only one meal a day. So if a mobile app can help few people survive, won’t that be great.
